# From Local to regional and meta food web structure in Antarctica 

# Ecological Network structure across scales: from local to regional

## Abstract

In recent years there has been an increased interest in spatial and temporal variation in food web structure. This is a necessary step to understand the influences of climate change and other global threats like biological invasions to ecosystems. The pool of species present in a broad geographic area and all their possible feeding interactions have been called meta-web, in analogy with the metacommunity concept. Local food webs are realizations of meta-webs that result from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints imposed by food web structure. The present study analysed the largest meta-web available up to now: the marine Antarctic meta-web with an area of 34.8 million Km^2^, and compared it with two food webs that represent different spatial scales: the regional Weddell Sea (3.5 million Km^2^) and the local Potter Cove (6.8 Km^2^). The meta-web was built using a dietary database of the Southern Ocean including species located at latitudes higher than 60°S. This set of species takes into account only the predator-prey interactions and does not have a real network structure. 
One way to analyse the assembly processes that shape food webs is to use motifs; which are subgraphs of nodes (i.e. species) and links (i.e. predation) whose frequency deviates significantly compared to a random network topology. Here we assessed three-node motifs as they are a tractable study unit, and some of them have been related to the persistence of food webs. There are 16 possible three-node motifs yet only four have ecological relevance: apparent and exploitative competition, omnivory and tri-trophic chain. Due to the huge dissimilarity in spatial scale among the studied food webs, the motif representation of the local---Potter Cove---web is expected to be more different to the meta-web than the regional---Weddel Sea---network. 
Another important property that characterizes the structure of food webs is the existence of subsets of species that interact more frequently among each other than with other species: modularity. This feature is also related to food web persistence as disturbances are restricted to modules and cannot propagate easily between them. Realized food webs (local and regional in this case) are expected to exhibit higher modularity than the meta-web.
Furthermore, we studied a quantitative measure of the small-world topology, which refers to networks with a short mean path length between species and tightly interconnected clusters of nodes. Networks that show the small-world pattern are more resistant to extinctions and have higher resilience. As the meta-web does not represent realized interactions, small-world-ness is expected to be similar to a random network. On the other hand, real-world food webs like the local and regional ones are predicted to largely differ from its random counterparts.  
Our results showed that the local, regional and meta-webs present a similar general pattern regarding motif frequency. In this sense, highest frequency was observed for the competition (exploitative and apparent, in this order) and omnivory motifs, which were over-represented with respect to random networks. On the contrary, the tri-trophic motif exhibited a lower frequency and was under-represented. Although such similar pattern, the frequency of the two competitive motifs in the local food web displayed an important difference: apparent competition was much higher than exploitative competition. 
Contrary to our expectations, the meta-web had the highest modularity and small-world-ness with values significantly different from the random networks. The regional and local food webs presented a similar structure with progressively less modularity and small-world-ness. Besides, the local web did not differ as expected from random networks regarding small-world-ness.   
As all networks displayed a comparable motif pattern, it seems that the food web structure is determined by evolutionary processes, neither assembly processes nor dynamical constraints have a strong influence on it. 

## Abstract 2

The idea that ecological networks are built in a sequence of colonization events is not new but has been mostly applied to competitive interactions. Similar processes act in trophic networks (food webs): a regional pool of species is the source from which species colonize local areas, called the meta-web.  Local food webs are realizations of meta-webs that result from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints imposed by food web structure. In the present study we analyse three spatial scales: the marine Antarctic meta-web representing an area of 34.8 million Km^2^, the regional Weddell Sea (3.5 million Km^2^) and the local Potter Cove (6.8 Km^2^). The meta-web was built using a dietary database of the Southern Ocean including species located at latitudes higher than 60°S. This set of species takes into account only the predator-prey interactions and does not have a real network structure. We analyse how this nested set of food-webs change across scales using properties at three levels: emergent global properties that take into account the whole network (like modularity), sub-structural properties that consider several nodes (like motifs), and properties related to one node (like topological roles). 
The global properties that are important for food webs stability and resilience: trophic coherence that is the tendency of nodes to fall into well defined trophic levels; a quantitative measure of the small-world topology, which refers to networks with a short mean path length between species and tightly interconnected clusters of nodes and modularity: the existence of subsets of species that interact more frequently among each other than with other species. As the intermediate level property, we analysed the frequency of three-node motifs that are important for food-webs. And as node-level property we analysed the within node degree that measures well a species is connected to other species inside the module, and the among-module connectivity that estimates how well a species is linked across modules. 
The meta-web had the highest modularity and small-world-ness with values significantly different from the random networks. The regional and local food webs presented a similar structure with progressively less modularity and small-world-ness. The coherence showed an opposite pattern with the meta web more similar to a random null model, and the local food web more different. Regarding motif frequency, the local, regional and meta-webs present a similar general pattern: highest frequency was observed for the competition (exploitative and apparent, in this order) and omnivory motifs, which were over-represented with respect to random networks. On the contrary, the tri-trophic motif exhibited a lower frequency and was under-represented. Beside that there are some differences: in the local food web apparent competition was much higher than exploitative competition, and in the meta web omnivory is higher than the others. Topological roles display a similar pattern across scales, with one difference the local does not have module hubs, which means less connectivity within modules.
We expected that the meta-web where more similar to a random network in global properties related to stability and resilience, only coherence showed that pattern. Coherence is related to local stability of food webs, this is coincident with the observed motif frequencies, the meta-web showed an excess of the omnivory that is the most unstable motif of the four analysed. The meta-web also showed a highly from a random structure regarding topological roles. We found that a great portion of the structure of the food webs is determined by evolutionary processes that act on large temporal and spatial scales, but non-adaptative selection or assembly processes also filter unstable structures at a local scale, this there is a mixture of processes determining food web structure. One important thing to consider is that the particular assembly process of food webs acts preserving the structure of the meta-web.

## Introduction

The characterization of ecological systems as networks of interacting elements has a long history [@May1972,@Cohen1985;@Paine1966], much of these work has devoted to investigate network structure and its effects on the dynamics and stability of networks [@Thebault2010]. In recent years the application of network theory and new developments in random matrix theory has greatly expanded our capability of analysis of ecological networks [@Guimaraes2016, @Allesina2015]. Besides that, the analysis of the effects of ecological dynamical processes on food web structure are not so well developed. On such dynamical process is community assembly: how species from a regional pool colonize a site and interact to form local communities [@Carstensen2013]. Regional pools are shaped by evolutionary and biogeographical processes that imply large spatial and temporal scales [@Carstensen2013]. Then the assembly of local communities is influenced by dispersal, environmental filters, biotic interactions and stochastic events [@HilleRisLambers2012]. These processes has been studied by means of metacommunity theory, where different spatial assemblages are connected through dispersal of multiple species. Metacommunity theory provides a framework for assessing which are the roles of local and regional-scale dynamics [@Baiser2013;@Leibold2004]. Traditionally metacommunity theory has been applied to competitive interactions, trophic interactions received much less attention [@Baiser2016]. 

<!--- Nonadaptative selection and assembly processes NOT INCLUDED-->

There are several approaches to characterize the structure of an ecological networks: emergent or global properties that focus on averages over the entire network (e.g.  modularity or connectance), and more local properties that focuses on how one or several species are related to the whole. Global properties related to resilience and stability are fundamental to understand the response of ecological networks to global treats like climate change and biological invasions. One of these properties is the small-world pattern, associated with rapid responses to disturbances and resistance to secondary extinctions [@Montoya2002]. The small-world pattern is related to two global properties: the average distance between all species, called the path length, and the clustering coefficient, the probability that two species linked to the same species are linked. Then Small-­world patterns imply a high level of clustering compared with a random graph, and a small average path length similar to that seen in random graphs [@Watts1998]. This pattern comes from the general network theory, beyond ecological networks, but has been mostly applied to marine food webs [@Navia2016;@Bornatowski2017;@Gray2016; @Marina2018]. 

<!--- Coherence -->
Since the early studies of @May1972 that found that larger and more connected ecosystems will be unstable there is a search of factors that would stabilize a food-web [@Garcia-Callejas2018], one of such properties is called trophic coherence [@Johnson2014]. Trophic coherence is based on the distances between the trophics levels of species and measures how well species fall into discrete trophic levels; thus more coherence implies a more hierarchical structure of the food-web and it is directly correlated with linear stability [@Johnson2014]. The advantage of coherence as an index of stability is that it does not make any assumptions about interaction strengths.

<!---Modularity -->

Food webs have highly non-random and structurally complex patterns that contain internal functional units or sub-modules [@Grilli2016]. These are groups of prey and predators that interact more strongly with each other than with species belonging to other sub-modules, the existence of these modules (also called compartments) acts buffering the propagation of extinctions throughout the network, thereby  increasing persistence [@Stouffer2011]. It is interesting to mention that small-world patterns and modularity act in opposite directions. The small-world structure favours that perturbations spread and dissipate rapidly [@Gray2016], and a high degree of modularity prevents the spread of perturbations [@Stouffer2011;@Krause2003]. The detection of these modules is an intermediate approach between the global and the local analysis. 

<!---Topological roles -->

There are important species in ecological networks that have disproportionately large effects on the whole ecosystem, like keystone species [@Paine1969], ecosystem engineers [@Jones1994] and network hubs [@Borthagaray2014]. Species can participate in different ways with respect to modularity: depending on how many feed links they have within their own module and/or between the modules [@Guimera2005; @Kortsch2015]. This participation has been called the species' topological role, theoretical and empirical results suggest this roles are related to species traits like wide niche breadth, environmental tolerance, apex position in local communities and high motility [@Borthagaray2014;@Guimera2010;@Rezende2009]. This is a local property at an individual species level. 

<!---Motifs -->


Thus we consider both kinds of properties,    

<!---Metaweb, regional, local food webs -->

* Food webs assembly evolutionary and dynamical constrains [@Poisot2012].

* We expect that at the metacommunity reflect the evolutionary constraints of the species interactions, and the regional and the local should be more influenced by assembly procesess and the local should be also strongly determined by the local environment. 

## Methods

We consider that the metaweb is the regional pool the species defined by the biogeographic Antarctic region  


## Results

* Topological roles: Local more random than Regional and Meta
