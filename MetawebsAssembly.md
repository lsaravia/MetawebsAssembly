# From Local to regional and continental food web structure in Antarctica 

## Abstract

In recent years there has been an increased interest in spatial and temporal variation in food web structure. This is a necessary step to understand the influences of climate change and other global threats like biological invasions to ecosystems. The pool of species present in a broad geographic area and all their possible feeding interactions have been called metaweb, in analogy with the metacommunity concept. Local food webs are realizations of metawebs that resulting from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints imposed by food web structure. In this work, we analyze the largest metaweb available up to now: the marine Antarctic metaweb and compare it with two food webs that represent different spatial scales: the regional Weddell Sea and the local Potter Cove. One gain insight into the processes that shape food webs is to use subgraphs of nodes (i.e. species)called motifs. In this regard, we examined the frequency of three-node motifs: tri-trophic chain, omnivory, apparent competition and exploitative competition. Due to the different spatial scales, the motif representation of the regional Weddel Sea network should be more similar to the metaweb than one exhibited in the local  Potter Cove food web. Another important property that characterizes the structure of food webs is the existence of subsets of species that interact more frequently among themselves than with other species: compartmentalization. As the metaweb do not represent realized interactions we expect that the local and regional webs will be more compartmentalized. We will also assess the structural properties the food webs, and compare all the results among networks to disentangle which processes are more important to shape food webs at different spatial scales.

## Hypothesis

Meta-web --> Weddell Sea : Random sampling (Local Motif representation should match the meta-web)

Meta-web --> Potter Cove : Habitat Filtering (Local Motif representation should be different from the meta-web)

Motifs provide a novel framework for exploring community assembly by explicitly including interactions as opposed to inferring them from patterns of taxonomic or phylogenetic composition. Focusing on community assembly through the lens of motifs can be thought of as interaction assembly. We analyze motifs in the assembly of ecological networks by using null models to search for motif significance (Milo et al. 2002, Bascompte and Melián 2005) at the regional and local scale and then comparing the representation of each motif (i.e. over-represented, under-represented, or random) between the regional and local networks to see if they match. When a given motif shows the same representation in the regional network and local networks assembled from it, the same forces (e.g. predation, resource limitation, neutral processes) may be structuring networks across scales. In this scenario, the local networks are representative subsets that maintain the motif patterns present in the regional network. On the other hand, when a motif shows a different representation across scales, it suggests that different processes are structuring the regional and local networks. The ecological theory associated with the above-mentioned food web motifs allows us to make predictions about when a given motif might be over-represented, under-represented, or random at both scales or show a divergent pattern of motif representation.

For example, the tri-trophic chain motif (Fig. 1) may show a pattern of over-representation in the regional network due to the fact that generalist top predators exist in the regional pool (e.g. a generalist top predator may only occur in one local food web, but all of the tri-trophic chains that it is part of will be present in the regional network). However, we know that low productivity (Kaunzinger and Morin 1998) and small ecosystem size among other factors (Post 2002), can reduce the probability that a species will establish at a high trophic level. As a result, the tri-trophic motif may be under-represented in local food webs. Conversely, if local ecosystems are large and/or productive, top predators may frequently be present and the tri-trophic chain motif may be over-represented showing the same pattern as the regional network. Within the metacommunity framework (Leibold et  al. 2004), this above scenario is similar to the species sorting concept. However, instead of variation in local conditions driving the establishment of individual species, our approach focuses on the number of motifs and as a result provides a potential mechanism for the assembly of food web networks (e.g. low productivity or ecosystem size precludes long chain lengths at local scales). An alternative mechanism for over-representation of the tri-trophic chain motif in the regional network and under-representation in local scale networks is that higher level consumers are poor dispersers. These are just a few examples of how ecological theory can inform our predictions of motif patterns during community assembly.
