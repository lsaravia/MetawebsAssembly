# From Local to regional and continental food web structure in Antarctica 

## Abstract

In recent years there has been an increased interest in spatial and temporal variation in food web structure. This is a necessary step to understand the influences of climate change and other global threats like biological invasions to ecosystems. The pool of species present in a broad geographic area and all their possible feeding interactions have been called metaweb, in analogy with the metacommunity concept. Local food webs are realizations of metawebs that resulting from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints imposed by food web structure. This paper analyzes the largest metaweb available up to now: the marine Antarctic metaweb and compares it with two food webs that represent different spatial scales: the regional Weddell Sea and the local Potter Cove. One gain insight into the processes that shape food webs is to use subgraphs of nodes (i.e. species) called motifs. The frequency of the following three-node motifs we analysed: tri-trophic chain, omnivory, apparent competition and exploitative competition. Due to the different spatial scales, the motif representation of the regional Weddel Sea network should be more similar to the metaweb than one exhibited in the local Potter Cove food web. Another important property that characterizes the structure of food webs is the existence of subsets of species that interact more frequently among themselves than with other species: compartmentalization. As the metaweb do not represent realized interactions we expect that the local and regional webs will be more compartmentalized. We will also assess the structural properties the food webs, and compare all the results among networks to disentangle which processes are more important to shape food webs at different spatial scales.
