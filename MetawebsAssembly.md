# From Local to regional and continental food web structure in Antarctica 

## Abstract

In recent years there has been an increased interest in spatial and temporal variation in food web structure. This is a necessary step to understand the influences of climate change and other global threats like biological invasions to ecosystems. The pool of species present in a broad geographic area and all their possible feeding interactions have been called meta-web, in analogy with the metacommunity concept. Local food webs are realizations of meta-webs that resulting from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints imposed by food web structure. This paper analyzes the largest meta-web available up to now: the marine Antarctic meta-web and compares it with two food webs that represent different spatial scales: the regional Weddell Sea and the local Potter Cove. One way to analyze the assembly  processes that shape food webs is to use subgraphs of nodes (i.e. species) called motifs. The frequency of the following three-node motifs we analyzed: tri-trophic chain, omnivory, apparent competition and exploitative competition. Due to the different spatial scales, the motif representation of the regional Weddel Sea network is expected to be more similar to the meta-web than one exhibited in the local Potter Cove food web. Another important property that characterizes the structure of food webs is the existence of subsets of species that interact more frequently among themselves than with other species: modularity. We also assess a quantitatively the small-world structure that means a tightly interconnected clusters of nodes, and a short mean path length. As the meta-web do not represent realized interactions we expect that it would be more similar to a random network with less modularity and less small-world-ness. Contrary to our expectations the meta-web has the highest modularity and small-world-ness, more frequency of the competition and omnivory motifs and an under-representation of tri-trophic motif compared with random networks. The regional and local food-webs had a similar structure with progressively less modularization. These suggest that local and regional food-webs are random samples of the meta food thus assembly processes are not heavily influencing food web structure and that evolutionary processes seems to be more important in shaping interactions and food web structure.
