## Figures and tables

![The four three-species sub-networks analysed: apparent competition, exploitative competition, tri-trophic chain, and omnivory. These four sub-networks have been explored both theoretically and empirically in ecological networks and are the most common sub-networks found in food webs](Figures/Fig1Motifs.png)

![Network motifs z-scores across scales. Motifs are three-node sub-networks counted on each of the networks.: the *Metaweb* represents the marine predator-prey relationships of Antarctica (34.8 million Km^2^); the *Weddell Sea* (3.5 million Km^2^) and *Potter Cove* (6.8 Km^2^) are local food webs. A. Z-scores estimated with the random null model. B. Z-scores estimated with the metaweb assembly model. Z-scores were normalized by the square root of the sum of the squared z-scores for that food web.](Figures/Motif_Zs_ByNetwork.png){ width=100% }

![Proportion of topological roles across scales., the *Metaweb* represents the marine predator-prey relationships of Antarctica (34.8 million Km^2^); the *Weddell Sea* (3.5 million Km^2^) and *Potter Cove* (6.8 Km^2^) are local food webs. The topological roles are: *Hub connectors*, high number of between-module links; *Module connectors*, low number of links mostly between modules; *Module hubs*, high number of links within its module; *Module specialists*, low number of links within its module. A. Observed proportions for each food web; significant differences were found between them (Chi-squared = 79.31, p-value = 9.9e-05). B. Proportions for local networks obtained from the metaweb assembly model; no differences were found (Chi-squared = 5.95, p-value = 0.41)](Figures/PropRoles_ByNetwork_Model.png){ width=80% }

![Plot of topological roles combined with trophic levels and modularity for each food web. The topological are: *Hub connectors* have a high number of between module links, *Module connectors* have a low number of links mostly between modules,  *Module hubs* have a high number of links inside its module. *Module specialists* have a low number of links inside its module. Size of the nodes is proportional to the log of the species degree.](Figures/AllTopoRoles_TL_MOD.png)

Table: Network global properties across scales. The *Metaweb* represents the marine predator-prey relationships of Antarctica, the *Weddell Sea* and *Potter Cove* are the local food webs. Z-scores were calculated against 1000 null model networks (random or metaweb assembly models). Quantities marked with '*' are significant at 1% level. A negative z-score means that the quantity is smaller than the expectation from null model simulations; a positive z-score means that is greater.
