# From Local to regional and continental food web structure  

## Hypothesis

Meta-web --> Potter Cove : Habitat Filtering (Local Motif representation should be different from the meta-web)

Motifs provide a novel framework for exploring community assembly by explicitly including interactions as opposed to inferring them from patterns of taxonomic or phylogenetic composition. Focusing on community assembly through the lens of motifs can be thought of as interaction assembly. We analyze motifs in the assembly of ecological networks by using null models to search for motif significance (Milo et al. 2002, Bascompte and Melián 2005) at the regional and local scale and then comparing the representation of each motif (i.e. over-represented, under-represented, or random) between the regional and local networks to see if they match. When a given motif shows the same representation in the regional network and local networks assembled from it, the same forces (e.g. predation, resource limitation, neutral processes) may be structuring networks across scales. In this scenario, the local networks are representative subsets that maintain the motif patterns present in the regional network. On the other hand, when a motif shows a different representation across scales, it suggests that different processes are structuring the regional and local networks. The ecological theory associated with the above-mentioned food web motifs allows us to make predictions about when a given motif might be over-represented, under-represented, or random at both scales or show a divergent pattern of motif representation.

For example, the tri-trophic chain motif (Fig. 1) may show a pattern of over-representation in the regional network due to the fact that generalist top predators exist in the regional pool (e.g. a generalist top predator may only occur in one local food web, but all of the tri-trophic chains that it is part of will be present in the regional network). However, we know that low productivity (Kaunzinger and Morin 1998) and small ecosystem size among other factors (Post 2002), can reduce the probability that a species will establish at a high trophic level. As a result, the tri-trophic motif may be under-represented in local food webs. Conversely, if local ecosystems are large and/or productive, top predators may frequently be present and the tri-trophic chain motif may be over-represented showing the same pattern as the regional network. Within the metacommunity framework (Leibold et  al. 2004), this above scenario is similar to the species sorting concept. However, instead of variation in local conditions driving the establishment of individual species, our approach focuses on the number of motifs and as a result provides a potential mechanism for the assembly of food web networks (e.g. low productivity or ecosystem size precludes long chain lengths at local scales). An alternative mechanism for over-representation of the tri-trophic chain motif in the regional network and under-representation in local scale networks is that higher level consumers are poor dispersers. These are just a few examples of how ecological theory can inform our predictions of motif patterns during community assembly.

Compartments in food webs act directly to
buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community
and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species.

@Gilarranz2017

We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size (number of compartments). However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that
protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.

From a network perspective, the ecological role of a species is a direct result of its position in the food web, the number of interactions it has with neighbouring species and their interactions, and also the strength of these interactions [13,14].
Some species are functionally more important than others and may have disproportionately large effects on food web structure [15]. Central and functionally unique species include keystone species, key species, ecosystem engineers and network hubs [16–18]. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that network hubs, or super-generalists, connect modules and communities due to their wide niche breadth, environmental tolerance, apex position in local communities and high motility [19–21]. If species affected by pertubations possess key functional roles in the food web, then the potential higher order, indirect effects of those pertubations on the entire food web structure can be dramatic.


We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations [I DO not think so!!]

@Humphries2008

Recent work has shown how the presence of
particular network ‘motifs’ — repeating patterns of connections
between a small number of nodes — can guarantee, for example, a
chaotic attractor for the network as a whole [36]. The functional
requirements of some real-world system may then lead to the
inclusion of particular motifs to guarantee the necessary dynamics
[37], and there is no necessary link between a system’s motifs and
its global topological properties (of which small-world-ness is but
one). Nonetheless, given that so many of the key motifs identified
so far are either complete 3-node loops or contain them [37,38],
the global topology will have a high clustering coefficient, and will
most likely be a small-world network

@Garcia-Callejas2017

Network analyses can provide insights into
community local stability (Allesina and Tang 2012) and
robustness to extinctions (Riede et al. 2011), the degree of
specialization of individual species or guilds (Dorado et al.
2011), the impact of invasive species or climate change on
established communities (Lopezaraiza-Mikel et  al. 2007)
and, more generally, on any question in which pairwise
interactions relate to community patterns and processes.

For example, among the factors reported to
stabilize food webs are high modularity and low connectance
(Thébault and Fontaine 2010), correlation in pairwise
interaction strengths (Tang et al. 2014), trophic coherence
(Johnson et  al. 2014), a preponderance of weak (McCann
et al. 1998) and asymmetrical interactions (Bascompte et al.
2006), degree distributions broader than those of random
graphs (Allesina et al. 2015), or the appearance of general-
ist consumers coupling resources with different interaction
strengths (Rip et al. 2010).

@Montoya2002

Another important question emerging from our study is how these food webs with SW topologies are constructed through community assembly rules, that is, how they are built dynamically. Even if a community is assembled by random addition of species through a process of biological invasions, interactions can lead to non-random webs (Drake, 1990a, b). The SW topology might be related to underlying community level constraints and might help in understanding as to how biodiversity emerges and persists through time.

@Johnson2014

Thanks to Pauly and colleagues’ seminal paper “Fishing down marine food webs” [57], the mean trophic level has come to be regarded as an indicator of an ecosystem’s health, to the extent that the Convention on Biological Diversity has mandated that signatory states report changes in this measure (renamed the Mean Trophic Index) for marine ecosystems.


---------------
@Johnson2017

It has recently been shown that the high linear stability of food
webs is determined mainly by a structural feature called “trophic
coherence,” a measure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct lev-
els (15). Trophic coherence, moreover, has been found to play
an important role in other structural and dynamical properties
of networks (16, 17).

The graphs corresponding to
food webs are significantly coherent (q/q < 1) and have slightly
lower mean trophic levels than the expectation (hsi/s̃ . 1).
The networks derived from gene regulation have coherence and
mean trophic levels that are very close to their expected val-
ues. Meanwhile, the networks linked to metabolism are signif-
icantly incoherent (q/q̃ > 1) and have mean trophic levels that
are higher than expected (hsi/s̃ > 1)

Food-web structure. Clearly, ecological systems do not follow a
random graph structure, for example, displaying a directionality
in the flow of energy from producers to consumers. This
directionality proved important in our previous study 36 , where
we showed that when the mean of the negative effects dominates
that of the positive effects, systems built according to the
cascade 37 model (in which ‘larger’ species consume ‘smaller’
ones) are more likely to be stable than their random counterparts.
We therefore analysed matrices constructed using a variation of
the cascade model, where we assign a ‘size’ to each species and
each species can only consume smaller species, and has a
preference for those in the same subsystem (Q40), or for those in
the other subsystem (Qo0)

The picture emerging from both simulations and mathematical analysis is much more complex than previously hypothesized. Block structure can have an effect on the local asymptotic stability of the underlying system. However, unless we are in particular areas of the parameter space, the effect tends to be destabilizing. Our results stress the fact that, when discussing the relationship between network structure and local stability, we need to qualify our statements, as a given structure is not stabilizing or destabilizing per se, but is only so under certain specific conditions.


Though we have illustrated this point by studying the modular structures, we believe this phenomenon to hold generally: any network structure can have different effects on stability, depending on the choice of parameters. To reinforce this message, in Fig. 7, we show three cases in which an empirical network structure makes the system more or less stable than its random counterpart, depending on the parameterization of the coefficients. Practically, this means that the challenge of proving that biological network structure emerges because of a selective process, removing configurations yielding unfavourable dynamics17–19 is much harder than expected: network structure, without estimates of the distribution of the coefficients, cannot be used to determine the effect on dynamical properties.

@Borrelli2015a

While large scale 
emergent properties of networks (modularity, nestedness,
connectance, etc.) has been the focus of much research in
the past, there are many other ways to characterize the struc-
ture of an ecological network. Here I assess the substructural
composition of food webs in light of the stability of their
basic building blocks (three-node subgraphs).

Subgraphs differed in how frequently they were observed relative to permuted webs (Fig. 2). Tritrophic chains (s1), apparent competition (s4), and direct competition (s5) all tended to be over-represented in food webs based on both null models.

Like the pattern of subgraphs in food webs, trophic coherence may be explained by the two hypotheses of constraints
on the assembly of the web, or intrinsic benefits of the structure. Johnson et al. (2014) suggest that adaptations for feeding on a given species may be more helpful for preying upon other species at a similar trophic level, evoking the idea of constraints on assembly of the web. The observed frequency of subgraphs may then be the result of such feeding preferences and the apparent relationship between stability and frequency only coincidental. 

One could also imagine that species vary in how they choose prey and when species feeding preferences lead to the increase of s1, s4 and s5 subgraphs the coherence of the web and therefore its stability increases. The observed pattern would then result from a combination of constraints on assembly and the intrinsic properties of the subgraphs (stability).

An ideal test of the hypothesis of selection against unstable configurations would involve food web assembly data. During food web assembly, new species enter the food web and establish feeding links with the species that are pres- ent. This establishment alters the structure of the food web, and can be measured as changes in the relative frequency of the different three-node subgraphs. Following the introduction of the new species one of two events could occur; 1) the new species becomes integrated into the network and the food web grows (in terms of the number of species), or 2) the introduction of the new species leads to extinction events and the food web shrinks. The selection against instability hypothesis would predict that when the addition of new species increases the relative frequency of more stable subgraphs
compared to less stable ones, the web should grow. If the frequency of less stable subgraphs is increased more than the stable ones, then extinctions would be more likely to occur.


Nonadaptive systemic selection can act on networks via
dynamical pruning, favoring configurations that are more
likely to lead to system persistence [31]. Similar nonran-
dom motif profiles could also arise by network assembly,
the effects of which have been found in both mutualistic
and trophic networks [33–37]. Only by developing strong
models of network assembly can one separate the effect of
dynamical pruning from that of network growth and de-
velopment. Assembly might not only involve systemic
selection, but also include other processes (e.g., priority
effects or constraints on colonization).

Bornatowski2017

This theory has been applied to several marine studies (e.g. Montoya & Solé, 2002; Lusseau et al., 2006; Fox & Bellwood, 2014; Navia et al., 2012). For example, Navia et al. (2016) proposed that this information
2016; a). Small-­world networks require a high level of clustering compared with a random graph, and a small average path length, similar to that seen in random graphs (Watts & Strogatz, 1998).

Small-­world food webs are, in theory, resistant to the loss of species with low centrality values (a measure of how many times the node participates in the dispersal effects in the network), but are sensitive to the loss of species with the highest values (e.g. Albert & Barabási, 2002; Clauset, Moore, & Newman, 2008; Gaichas & Francis, 2008; Jordano, Bascompte, & Olesen, 2003; Montoya & Solé, 2002; Solé & Montoya, 2001).

Thereby, the small-­world structural pattern (based on the clustering co-­efficient) has been associated with rapid responses to various disturbances in several theoretical food webs, suggesting that this arrangement may benefit web resilience. In this respect, Solé and Montoya (2001) and Montoya and Solé (2002) determined that food webs with small-­world structural arrangements were more resistant to secondary extinction of species than networks with random structures. However, trophic interactions are flexible and the response of the community is much less predictable, and so properties of structures of networks should not be taken for granted (Navia et al., 2016).

@Gray2016


As with other features of the whole network (such as connectance) or parts of
the network (e.g. generality) the so-called ‘small-world’ properties of food webs
have also been linked to stability (Watts & Strogatz 1998; Montoya & Solé 2002) and
to the rate at which perturbations propagate (Montoya, Pimm & Solé 2006).
Essentially, if species are highly connected to the rest of the food web in a ‘small-
world’ network, then perturbations may spread (and dissipate) rapidly, but if there
are less well connected (more degrees of separation) this may lead to longer-lived
oscillatory dynamics and feedbacks that require a long time to reach equilibrium.
Thus, it is not simply the linkage density or strength of connections that are
important for determining stability or food-web inertia, but their particular
configuration. Even large food webs from circumneutral or higher pH systems can
exhibit these properties, with most species being only 1-2 degrees of separation from
the rest of the web (Thompson et al. 2015). Network efficiency (see Text Box) is a
measure of how well connected a network is, as well as the distribution of those
connections across a network (Latora & Marchiori 2001), and can enable inferences
to be made about the small-world properties of food webs. Although rarely applied
to date in food web studies, this metric derived from the wider field of network
science could provide new insights into how these small-world aspects of food web
topology itself might shape the trajectory of biological recovery (Monteith et al. 2005;
Layer et al. 2010b). The lengthening of food chains associated with the re-invasion of
consumers might be expected to increase the overall efficiency of the network, as the
wider breadth of diet of new, large, top predators effectively reduces the distance (in
terms of number of links) between resources.

@Mougi2016

Here, we propose that spatial heterogeneity alone, as a general and inherent feature of any natural ecosystem,
can elicit a positive complexity-stability effect. Our world is undoubtedly spatial, and species interactions are
spatially limited 17 . Stabilizing effects of spatiality on prey-predator population dynamics have been well recog-
nized and studied both theoretically and empirically 18–20 . However, those studies considered simple communities
consisting of only a few species 17,21,22 , did not account for spatial effects 23,24 , did not examine interactions between
food-web complexity and spatiality 25 or food-web complexity is only realized as a result of spatial aggregation of
local simple sub-webs 26–28 . Thus, how essential spatiality may be for the persistence of more complex food webs
is still not clear. We aim to reveal that the incorporation of spatiality may totally change, and even reverse, our
understanding of how ecosystem complexity affects ecosystem stability.

--------------------
@Poisot2012

Understanding how local realisations relate to it paves the way to the development of a biogeography of species interactions. Given the multiple drivers of local community composition (species filtering, historical contingencies and stochasticity), only a subset of species will be present at each locality, thus potentially realising only a subsample (the alpha diversity) of all the possible interactions found in the metaweb (the gamma diversity; Fig. 1).


--------------------

@Borrelli2014

Two patterns found in real food webs have been hypothesized to have been produced by
selection on stability: short food chains (Borrelli and Ginzburg 2014) and three-species motif
profiles (Borrelli 2015). These patterns represent a signature of the selection process because
they are structures that both have a high probability of being stable and a high frequency in
observed food webs.

@Jacob2011

The Southern Ocean (Figure 1) ecosystem exhibits a number of unique features, including around 25 million years of bio-geographic isolation (Barnes, 2005; Clarke, 1985; Hempel, 1985) and, in the form of the annual formation and retreat of sea ice, the geographically most extensive seasonal environmental oscillation pattern in the world. Consequently, there are a number of unusual ecological features, such as a high degree of endemism (Arntz et al., 1994, 1997) and the occupation of the ‘pelagic swarm fish niche’ by euphausiid crustaceans (Bergstrom and Chown, 1999; Ichii and Kato, 1991).

@Stouffer2007

Food webs aim to provide a thorough representation of the trophic interactions found in an ecosystem. The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web ‘motifs’ which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model. Our result conclusively demonstrates that predation upon species with some ‘characteristic’ niche value is the prey selection mechanism consistent with the structural properties of empirical food webs.

It is clear that this randomization scheme maintains the
same species as cannibals before and after. Owing to this fact,
and the fact that the appearance of cannibalism in food webs is
consistent with the random hypothesis ( Williams & Martinez
2000; Stouffer et al. 2005), we neglect cannibalism in our
investigation of prey selection mechanisms.
