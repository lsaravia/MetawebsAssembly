# From Local to regional and continental food web structure  


### Migration/dispersal

@RyserRemo2019

Based on empirical observations (e.g. [35]) and previous theoretical frameworks (e.g. [4,12,34,42]), we assume that the maximum dispersal distance of animal species increases with their body mass. As plants are passive dispersers, we model their maximum dispersal distance as random and body mass independent. We model emigration rates as a function of each species’ per capita net growth rate, which is summarizing local conditions such as resource availability, predation pressure, and inter- and intraspecific competition [43]




Hypothesis: 
1) food-webs have evolutionary, assembly and dynamical constraints that shape their structure
2) 


At Potter Cove that has a smaller extent we expected to be more constrained by biotic interactions than the Weddell sea [@Araujo2014], so it should be more stable and more modular than the metaweb, on the contrary Weddell see food-web is the only more coherent than the metaweb   

The inclusion of traits in the metaweb assembly model will likely improve it, traits like mobility, body size, and depth range, would prevent species to go Potter Cove e.g. large and highly mobile species will seldom enter the Cove, and species of deep waters will also be excluded. 

Another possible explication is that there is a feedback from local dynamical process towards regional and that the structure of the metaweb already have incorporated the dynamical constraints [@Mittelbach2015].  


# Abstract 1889294

The idea that ecological networks are built in a sequence of colonization events is not new but has been applied mostly to competitive interactions. Similar processes act in trophic networks, i.e. food webs: a regional pool of species act as the source from which species colonize local areas, called the metaweb. Local food webs are realizations of metawebs that result from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints imposed by food-web structure. We analyse how the structure of a metaweb influence local food webs with different spatial scales, using an assembly model, a random model and properties at three levels: emergent global properties that take into account the whole network e.g. modularity, sub-structural properties that consider several nodes e.g. motifs, and properties related to one node e.g. topological roles. Three independent data-sets were included: the marine Antarctic metaweb (34.8 million Km2), the Weddell Sea (3.5 million Km2) and Potter Cove (6.8 Km2) food webs. Looking at the global properties, the metaweb presents a structure very different from the random model, while the local food webs follow the same pattern and are very similar to the assembly model. The assembly model only takes into account migration, local extinction and secondary extinctions. For sub-structural properties the metaweb and the local food webs also showed the same pattern against the random model, but we found differences compared to the assembly model that did not increase the local stability of food webs. Topological roles also showed differences between the metaweb and local food webs that were explained by the assembly model. We found that a great portion of the structure of the food webs is determined by evolutionary processes that act on large temporal and spatial scales. On the contrary, dynamical processes that favour stability have a small influence, but habitat filtering or dispersal limitations seem to be important factors that determine food web structure.

Similar processes act in trophic networks: a regional pool of species is the source from which species colonize local areas, called the metaweb. Local food webs are realizations of metawebs that result from assembly processes influenced by migration, habitat filtering, stochastic factors, and dynamical constraints. We analyse how the structure of a metaweb influence local food webs evaluating structural properties by means of a random and an assembly model. Three data-sets were included: the marine Antarctic metaweb, the Weddell Sea and Potter Cove food webs. The metaweb presents a structure very different from the random model, while the local food webs are very similar to the assembly model. Thus most of the local food web structure is inherited from the metaweb, with changes produced by habitat filtering or dispersal limitations.

mostly of motifs structure seems to be consequences of evolutionary or coevolutionary forces, this kind of structures that are a sub-product of process that happen at a different level have been called spandrels of assembly [@Sole2006a].

@Baiser2016

Motifs provide a novel framework for exploring community assembly by explicitly including interactions as opposed to inferring them from patterns of taxonomic or phylogenetic composition. Focusing on community assembly through the lens of motifs can be thought of as interaction assembly. We analyze motifs in the assembly of ecological networks by using null models to search for motif significance (Milo et al. 2002, Bascompte and Melián 2005) at the regional and local scale and then comparing the representation of each motif (i.e. over-represented, under-represented, or random) between the regional and local networks to see if they match. When a given motif shows the same representation in the regional network and local networks assembled from it, the same forces (e.g. predation, resource limitation, neutral processes) may be structuring networks across scales. In this scenario, the local networks are representative subsets that maintain the motif patterns present in the regional network. On the other hand, when a motif shows a different representation across scales, it suggests that different processes are structuring the regional and local networks. The ecological theory associated with the above-mentioned food web motifs allows us to make predictions about when a given motif might be over-represented, under-represented, or random at both scales or show a divergent pattern of motif representation.

For example, the tri-trophic chain motif (Fig. 1) may show a pattern of over-representation in the regional network due to the fact that generalist top predators exist in the regional pool (e.g. a generalist top predator may only occur in one local food web, but all of the tri-trophic chains that it is part of will be present in the regional network). However, we know that low productivity (Kaunzinger and Morin 1998) and small ecosystem size among other factors (Post 2002), can reduce the probability that a species will establish at a high trophic level. As a result, the tri-trophic motif may be under-represented in local food webs. Conversely, if local ecosystems are large and/or productive, top predators may frequently be present and the tri-trophic chain motif may be over-represented showing the same pattern as the regional network. Within the metacommunity framework (Leibold et  al. 2004), this above scenario is similar to the species sorting concept. However, instead of variation in local conditions driving the establishment of individual species, our approach focuses on the number of motifs and as a result provides a potential mechanism for the assembly of food web networks (e.g. low productivity or ecosystem size precludes long chain lengths at local scales). An alternative mechanism for over-representation of the tri-trophic chain motif in the regional network and under-representation in local scale networks is that higher level consumers are poor dispersers. These are just a few examples of how ecological theory can inform our predictions of motif patterns during community assembly.

@Stouffer2011

Compartments in food webs act directly to
buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community
and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species.


------------

@Gilarranz2017

We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size (number of compartments). However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that
protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.

@Kortsch2015


From a network perspective, the ecological role of a species is a direct result of its position in the food web, the number of interactions it has with neighbouring species and their interactions, and also the strength of these interactions [13,14].
Some species are functionally more important than others and may have disproportionately large effects on food web structure [15]. Central and functionally unique species include keystone species, key species, ecosystem engineers and network hubs [16–18]. Theoretical and empirical results suggest that network hubs, or super-generalists, connect modules and communities due to their wide niche breadth, environmental tolerance, apex position in local communities and high motility [19–21]. If species affected by pertubations possess key functional roles in the food web, then the potential higher order, indirect effects of those pertubations on the entire food web structure can be dramatic.


We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations [I DO not think so!!]


-------------
@Humphries2008

Recent work has shown how the presence of
particular network ‘motifs’ — repeating patterns of connections
between a small number of nodes — can guarantee, for example, a
chaotic attractor for the network as a whole [36]. The functional
requirements of some real-world system may then lead to the
inclusion of particular motifs to guarantee the necessary dynamics
[37], and there is no necessary link between a system’s motifs and
its global topological properties (of which small-world-ness is but
one). Nonetheless, given that so many of the key motifs identified
so far are either complete 3-node loops or contain them [37,38],
the global topology will have a high clustering coefficient, and will
most likely be a small-world network

@Garcia-Callejas2017

Network analyses can provide insights into
community local stability (Allesina and Tang 2012) and
robustness to extinctions (Riede et al. 2011), the degree of
specialization of individual species or guilds (Dorado et al.
2011), the impact of invasive species or climate change on
established communities (Lopezaraiza-Mikel et  al. 2007)
and, more generally, on any question in which pairwise
interactions relate to community patterns and processes.

For example, among the factors reported to
stabilize food webs are high modularity and low connectance
(Thébault and Fontaine 2010), correlation in pairwise
interaction strengths (Tang et al. 2014), trophic coherence
(Johnson et  al. 2014), a preponderance of weak (McCann
et al. 1998) and asymmetrical interactions (Bascompte et al.
2006), degree distributions broader than those of random
graphs (Allesina et al. 2015), or the appearance of general-
ist consumers coupling resources with different interaction
strengths (Rip et al. 2010).

---------------
@Montoya2002

Another important question emerging from our study is how these food webs with SW topologies are constructed through community assembly rules, that is, how they are built dynamically. Even if a community is assembled by random addition of species through a process of biological invasions, interactions can lead to non-random webs (Drake, 1990a, b). The SW topology might be related to underlying community level constraints and might help in understanding as to how biodiversity emerges and persists through time.

@Johnson2014

Thanks to Pauly and colleagues’ seminal paper “Fishing down marine food webs” [57], the mean trophic level has come to be regarded as an indicator of an ecosystem’s health, to the extent that the Convention on Biological Diversity has mandated that signatory states report changes in this measure (renamed the Mean Trophic Index) for marine ecosystems.


---------------
@Johnson2017

It has recently been shown that the high linear stability of food
webs is determined mainly by a structural feature called “trophic
coherence,” a measure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct lev-
els (15). Trophic coherence, moreover, has been found to play
an important role in other structural and dynamical properties
of networks (16, 17).

The graphs corresponding to
food webs are significantly coherent (q/q < 1) and have slightly
lower mean trophic levels than the expectation (hsi/s̃ . 1).
The networks derived from gene regulation have coherence and
mean trophic levels that are very close to their expected val-
ues. Meanwhile, the networks linked to metabolism are signif-
icantly incoherent (q/q̃ > 1) and have mean trophic levels that
are higher than expected (hsi/s̃ > 1)

@Grilli2016


Therefore, we contrast the value for the real part of the ‘rightmost’ eigenvalue of M, Re(l M,1 ), with
e a matrix with exactly the same Reðl M;1~ Þ, the value found for M, coefficients, but re-arranged according to a random network structure (Q 1⁄4 0). Re(l M,1 ), is a measure of stability, as it expresses the amount of self-regulation we would need to stabilize the equilibrium

Food-web structure. Clearly, ecological systems do not follow a random graph structure, for example, displaying a directionality in the flow of energy from producers to consumers. This directionality proved important in our previous study 36 , where we showed that when the mean of the negative effects dominates that of the positive effects, systems built according to the cascade 37 model (in which ‘larger’ species consume ‘smaller’ ones) are more likely to be stable than their random counterparts. We therefore analysed matrices constructed using a variation of the cascade model, where we assign a ‘size’ to each species and each species can only consume smaller species, and has a preference for those in the same subsystem (Q40), or for those in the other subsystem (Qo0).

The picture emerging from both simulations and mathematical analysis is much more complex than previously hypothesized. Block structure can have an effect on the local asymptotic stability of the underlying system. However, unless we are in particular areas of the parameter space, the effect tends to be destabilizing. Our results stress the fact that, when discussing the relationship between network structure and local stability, we need to qualify our statements, as a given structure is not stabilizing or destabilizing per se, but is only so under certain specific conditions.

Though we have illustrated this point by studying the modular structures, we believe this phenomenon to hold generally: any network structure can have different effects on stability, depending on the choice of parameters. To reinforce this message, in Fig. 7, we show three cases in which an empirical network structure makes the system more or less stable than its random counterpart, depending on the parameterization of the coefficients. 

Practically, this means that the challenge of proving that biological network structure emerges because of a selective process, removing configurations yielding unfavourable dynamics17–19 is much harder than expected: network structure, without estimates of the distribution of the coefficients, cannot be used to determine the effect on dynamical properties.

------------------
@Borrelli2015a

While large scale 
emergent properties of networks (modularity, nestedness,
connectance, etc.) has been the focus of much research in
the past, there are many other ways to characterize the struc-
ture of an ecological network. Here I assess the substructural
composition of food webs in light of the stability of their
basic building blocks (three-node subgraphs).

Subgraphs differed in how frequently they were observed relative to permuted webs (Fig. 2). Tritrophic chains (s1), apparent competition (s4), and direct competition (s5) all tended to be over-represented in food webs based on both null models.

Like the pattern of subgraphs in food webs, trophic coherence may be explained by the two hypotheses of constraints
on the assembly of the web, or intrinsic benefits of the structure. Johnson et al. (2014) suggest that adaptations for feeding on a given species may be more helpful for preying upon other species at a similar trophic level, evoking the idea of constraints on assembly of the web. The observed frequency of subgraphs may then be the result of such feeding preferences and the apparent relationship between stability and frequency only coincidental. 

One could also imagine that species vary in how they choose prey and when species feeding preferences lead to the increase of s1, s4 and s5 subgraphs the coherence of the web and therefore its stability increases. The observed pattern would then result from a combination of constraints on assembly and the intrinsic properties of the subgraphs (stability).

An ideal test of the hypothesis of selection against unstable configurations would involve food web assembly data. During food web assembly, new species enter the food web and establish feeding links with the species that are present. This establishment alters the structure of the food web, and can be measured as changes in the relative frequency of the different three-node subgraphs. Following the introduction of the new species one of two events could occur; 1) the new species becomes integrated into the network and the food web grows (in terms of the number of species), or 2) the introduction of the new species leads to extinction events and the food web shrinks. The selection against instability hypothesis would predict that when the addition of new species increases the relative frequency of more stable subgraphs compared to less stable ones, the web should grow. If the frequency of less stable subgraphs is increased more than the stable ones, then extinctions would be more likely to occur.


Nonadaptive systemic selection can act on networks via dynamical pruning, favoring configurations that are more likely to lead to system persistence [31]. Similar nonrandom motif profiles could also arise by network assembly, the effects of which have been found in both mutualistic and trophic networks [33–37]. Only by developing strong models of network assembly can one separate the effect of dynamical pruning from that of network growth and development. Assembly might not only involve systemic selection, but also include other processes (e.g., priority effects or constraints on colonization).


--------------------

Bornatowski2017

This theory has been applied to several marine studies (e.g. Montoya & Solé, 2002; Lusseau et al., 2006; Fox & Bellwood, 2014; Navia et al., 2012). a). Small-­world networks require a high level of clustering compared with a random graph, and a small average path length, similar to that seen in random graphs (Watts & Strogatz, 1998).

Small-­world food webs are, in theory, resistant to the loss of species with low centrality values (a measure of how many times the node participates in the dispersal effects in the network), but are sensitive to the loss of species with the highest values (e.g. Albert & Barabási, 2002; Clauset, Moore, & Newman, 2008; Gaichas & Francis, 2008; Jordano, Bascompte, & Olesen, 2003; Montoya & Solé, 2002; Solé & Montoya, 2001).

Thereby, the small-­world structural pattern (based on the clustering co-­efficient) has been associated with rapid responses to various disturbances in several theoretical food webs, suggesting that this arrangement may benefit web resilience. In this respect, Solé and Montoya (2001) and Montoya and Solé (2002) determined that food webs with small-­world structural arrangements were more resistant to secondary extinction of species than networks with random structures. However, trophic interactions are flexible and the response of the community is much less predictable, and so properties of structures of networks should not be taken for granted (Navia et al., 2016).


----------------------
@Gray2016 Recovery and Nonrecovery of Freshwater Food Webs from the Effects of Acidification


As with other features of the whole network (such as connectance) or parts of
the network (e.g. generality) the so-called ‘small-world’ properties of food webs
have also been linked to stability (Watts & Strogatz 1998; Montoya & Solé 2002) and
to the rate at which perturbations propagate (Montoya, Pimm & Solé 2006).
Essentially, if species are highly connected to the rest of the food web in a ‘small-
world’ network, then perturbations may spread (and dissipate) rapidly, but if there
are less well connected (more degrees of separation) this may lead to longer-lived
oscillatory dynamics and feedbacks that require a long time to reach equilibrium.
Thus, it is not simply the linkage density or strength of connections that are
important for determining stability or food-web inertia, but their particular
configuration. Even large food webs from circumneutral or higher pH systems can
exhibit these properties, with most species being only 1-2 degrees of separation from
the rest of the web (Thompson et al. 2015). Network efficiency (see Text Box) is a
measure of how well connected a network is, as well as the distribution of those
connections across a network (Latora & Marchiori 2001), and can enable inferences
to be made about the small-world properties of food webs. Although rarely applied
to date in food web studies, this metric derived from the wider field of network
science could provide new insights into how these small-world aspects of food web
topology itself might shape the trajectory of biological recovery (Monteith et al. 2005;
Layer et al. 2010b). The lengthening of food chains associated with the re-invasion of
consumers might be expected to increase the overall efficiency of the network, as the
wider breadth of diet of new, large, top predators effectively reduces the distance (in
terms of number of links) between resources.


---------------------

@Mougi2016

Here, we propose that spatial heterogeneity alone, as a general and inherent feature of any natural ecosystem,
can elicit a positive complexity-stability effect. Our world is undoubtedly spatial, and species interactions are
spatially limited 17 . Stabilizing effects of spatiality on prey-predator population dynamics have been well recog-
nized and studied both theoretically and empirically 18–20 . However, those studies considered simple communities
consisting of only a few species 17,21,22 , did not account for spatial effects 23,24 , did not examine interactions between
food-web complexity and spatiality 25 or food-web complexity is only realized as a result of spatial aggregation of
local simple sub-webs 26–28 . Thus, how essential spatiality may be for the persistence of more complex food webs
is still not clear. We aim to reveal that the incorporation of spatiality may totally change, and even reverse, our
understanding of how ecosystem complexity affects ecosystem stability.

--------------------
@Poisot2012

Understanding how local realisations relate to it paves the way to the development of a biogeography of species interactions. Given the multiple drivers of local community composition (species filtering, historical contingencies and stochasticity), only a subset of species will be present at each locality, thus potentially realising only a subsample (the alpha diversity) of all the possible interactions found in the metaweb (the gamma diversity; Fig. 1).

We expect that the connectance of the metaweb will be lower than the connectance of each local network (realisation), as even a single occurrence of one interaction will be reported into the metaweb (Gravel et al. 2011b).


--------------------

@Borrelli2014

Two patterns found in real food webs have been hypothesized to have been produced by
selection on stability: short food chains (Borrelli and Ginzburg 2014) and three-species motif
profiles (Borrelli 2015). These patterns represent a signature of the selection process because
they are structures that both have a high probability of being stable and a high frequency in
observed food webs.


---------------------

@Jacob2011

The Southern Ocean (Figure 1) ecosystem exhibits a number of unique features, including around 25 million years of bio-geographic isolation (Barnes, 2005; Clarke, 1985; Hempel, 1985) and, in the form of the annual formation and retreat of sea ice, the geographically most extensive seasonal environmental oscillation pattern in the world. Consequently, there are a number of unusual ecological features, such as a high degree of endemism (Arntz et al., 1994, 1997) and the occupation of the ‘pelagic swarm fish niche’ by euphausiid crustaceans (Bergstrom and Chown, 1999; Ichii and Kato, 1991).


----------------------

@Stouffer2007

Food webs aim to provide a thorough representation of the trophic interactions found in an ecosystem. The complexity of empirical food webs, however, is leading many ecologists to focus dynamic ecosystem studies on smaller microcosm or mesocosm studies based upon community modules, which comprise three to five species and the interactions likely to have ecological relevance. We provide here a structural counterpart to community modules. We investigate food-web ‘motifs’ which are n-species connected subgraphs found within the food web. Remarkably, we find that the over- and under-representation of three-species motifs in empirical food webs can be understood through comparison to a static food-web model, the niche model. Our result conclusively demonstrates that predation upon species with some ‘characteristic’ niche value is the prey selection mechanism consistent with the structural properties of empirical food webs.

It is clear that this randomization scheme maintains the
same species as cannibals before and after. Owing to this fact,
and the fact that the appearance of cannibalism in food webs is
consistent with the random hypothesis ( Williams & Martinez
2000; Stouffer et al. 2005), we neglect cannibalism in our
investigation of prey selection mechanisms.


-----------------

@Liao2016

Classical metacommunity models have recently explored
how food web dynamics respond to patch loss, but the effects of patch fragmentation have largely been
overlooked. Here we develop an extended patch-dynamic model that tracks the patch occupancy of the
various trophic links subject to colonization-extinction-predation dynamics by incorporating species
dispersal with patch connectivity. We found that, in a simple food chain, species at higher trophic level
become extinct sooner with increasing patch loss and fragmentation due to the constraint in resource
availability, confirming the trophic rank hypothesis. Yet, effects of fragmentation on species occupancy
are largely determined by patch loss, with maximal fragmentation effects occurring at intermediate
patch loss. Compared to the spatially explicit simulations that we also performed, the current model
with pair approximation generates similar community patterns especially in spatially clustered
landscapes.


-----------------

@Magurran2018

The world’s biodiversity is under unprecedented threat due to human activities, yet we have an incomplete understanding of ecosystem change in response to these pressures. Here we present data from a new 5-y study of a tropical freshwater ecosystem showing that change in the two dimensions of biodiversity—assemblage diversity (number and abundance of species) and assemblage composition—is decoupled from and uncorrelated among taxa. Assemblage diversity is typically stable over time. However, in line with Darwin’s expectation that community composition is constantly changing, this stability can be accompanied by marked turnover in species identities. Our paper thus identifies an important question for future research: at what point does compositional turnover threaten ecosystem resilience?

@Eklof2006 Species loss and secondary extinctions in simple and complex model communities

We find that highly connected food webs are, on average, more resistant to species loss than webs with low connectance. The most probable explanation of this pattern is that in highly connected webs most consumers have several prey species, so the loss of one of them will not be that catastrophic (see also MacArthur 1955) There might be additional reasons behind the pat- tern we have found. As the number of links (and hence connectance) in our model webs increases so does the proportion of these links that are weak because we assume each consumer to have a strong effect on one of its prey species and weak effects on the others. Thus, mean per capita interaction strength decreases with increasing connectance

However, comparing the results from dynamic and topological analyses of our model webs we find that topological analysis predict fewer secondary extinctions following the loss of species, especially in highly connected webs, than analysis taking dynamics into account. This is to be expected (see Introduction).

-------------------
@Curtsdotter2011

This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences.

-------------------

@Monteiro2017

* Historically, food-web theory has examined the aspects of natural communities that are responsible for maintaining stability in complex communities. The two main lines of research emphasize either topological aspects damping the propagation of perturbations, or population–stability mechanisms that regulate population outbreaks and prevent a total system destabilization. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that these two aspects act synergistically to produce a single conceptual framework. * Nevertheless, causal relationships are still unexplored: it remains uncertain if topological patterns maintain population stability, or alternatively, if population stability promotes food-web topology. * In this contribution, we explored the causal relationships between food-web topology and population stability within complex communities. We generated food webs, using three models with specific biological assumptions, and measured three population-stability variables, i.e. the proportion of locally stable three-species and four-species modules and the proportion of stable matrices; and two topological variables, i.e. modularity and degree of omnivory. We then used path analysis to evaluate two causality hypotheses, in which (i) topology promotes population stability, and (ii) population stability promotes food-web topology. * We found that population stability promoted food-web topology for all models, despite the different biological assumptions. We also observed consistent causal relationships between variables, in accordance with recent literature. * These results suggest that studies that intend to discuss the appearance of omnivorous behaviour or the stabilization aspect of compartmentalization, should first consider the stability of population dynamics. Additionally, they strongly support a recently proposed theory of an intrinsic mechanism to natural communities, selecting topologies capable of producing an equilibrium point where all species could coexist, and shaping natural communities to a similar and consistent pattern.


McCann and Hastings (1997) long argued that it is important to
evaluate the effect of interaction strengths on the stabilizing pro-
cesses of the omnivory module. Only recently, however, Gellner
and McCann (2012) linked population stability and topological
aspects to propose the specific conditions for stability.

to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web.

Nevertheless, since the seminal work of May (1972), it has been considered that modular or compartmentalized patterns described in food webs increase network stability, retaining the impacts of a perturbation within a single module and minimizing impacts on other modules (Krause et al. 2003; Teng & McCann 2004; see, however, Pimm 1979).

Finally, our results illustrate the importance of spatial scale for understanding how food webs are structured and how they function. Cumulative or aggregated food webs are useful to represent and compare food-web structure of larger regions (NS, NB, PEI, Atlantic). However, these cumulative webs produce different results from food webs at smaller spatial scales (study sites, region by impact level, or region). These differences are mainly driven by changes in the number of trophic groups that occur at each site and their ecological roles, as well as by the uncertainty of the data and sampling limitations. Therefore, the best approach to study food-web structure and functioning may be to combine ecological data with different spatial resolutions. Neighboring areas may show significant differences in food-web organization driven by local or regional factors that are overlooked when data are integrated and only cumulative food webs are studied, as commonly done (e.g. [21,38]). Similar conclusions regarding the importance of the spatial scale of study were drawn in an analysis of data collected in several streams at various spatial scales [44] and more generally in other ecosystems [45]. This is a relevant issue in food-web ecology in general as food webs are typically assembled in aggregated forms (cumula- tive or summary webs) due to limited data availability on trophic interactions.


---------------------
@Thompson2005

It has been suggested that food webs should be constrained by the home range of the top predator in the system (Cousins 1996). For many streams, this would require inclusion of information appropriate to the large scales over which predatory fish forage, or flying adults disperse. Equally, however, moving to larger scales can obscure important information or introduce error into our measurement of food-web attributes. This study suggests that patch-scale ecological processes structure food webs at a small spatial scale, but that these are not emergent at a larger spatial scale. Aggregating individuals from across patches may result in underestimates of food-web attributes such as connectance, with consequent implications for the generation of models that rely on those attributes.

As proposed by Zobel (1997) and illustrated in Fig. 1, the assembly processes can be envisaged as ‘filters’ operating at different scales. In this scheme, the ‘global species pool’ consists of all existing species, the ‘regional pool’ of all species able to colonise a given area, and the ‘local species pool’ of the set of species found at the finest scale considered (Cornell & Harrison 2014). Clearly, the species pools found at finer scales are filtered also by assembly processes acting at broader scales (Cornell & Lawton 1992).

In general, biotic interactions are likely to be more important at the finest scales, where species physically meet, whereas environmental covariates (such as macroclimate and soil types) are likely to be more important at broader scales (Araujo & Rozenfeld 2014).

 Models for predicting ecological behaviour typically require large volumes of data for parameterisation, which is a problem because data are scarce. Qualitative modelling (QM) provides an alternative by exploring the entire range of possible parameter values. When a parameter value is completely unknown, QM typically invokes the Principle of Indifference (PoI), for example by sampling the parameter from a uniform prior distribution However, if PoI is invoked in this probabilistic way, there may be multiple possible methods for defining a parameter space and sampling values from it, and, worryingly two different but equally defensible methods can lead to different predictions about ecosystem responses. 2 We investigated how probabilistic PoI can give rise to problems in QM, and developed an alternative method based on Boolean PoI that does not suffer the same limitations We used a case study that involved predicting the responses of multiple species to the suppression of a pest. The unknown model parameters were interaction strengths between species. For the standard probabilistic method, we drew the parameters randomly from uniform (PoI) and other distributions. For our new Boolean PoI method, we instead simply specified the ranges of ?possible? parameter values, and developed a Boolean analysis technique to summarise model predictions. 3 As expected, invoking probabilistic QM yielded diff erent predictions (species response probabilities) for different but equally defensible parameterisation and sampling schemes Sometimes differences were large enough to impact decision making. In contrast, our new Boolean PoI approach simply classifies outcomes (species responses) as certain, possible, or impossible. Encouragingly, some species responses that were not consistently resolved under probabilistic PoI were shown by our method to be in fact governed by simple rules. Our method can also identify key species whose responses determine whole-system outcomes. 4 Our non-probabilistic representation of uncertainty circumvents the philosophical problems in standard implementations of PoI for QM. Our Boolean analysis method summarises results in a way that is interpretable and potentially useful to conservation decision makers. A priority for future research is to increase the efficiency of our Boolean approach to allow it to deal with problems of higher complexity (more interactions).

A stable modular pattern may influence network robustness. In theoretical networks, modularity enhanced stability (May 1972; Krause et al. 2003). Sinha (2005), on the other hand, found that the transition point from stability to instability did not differ between modular and random networks, but the transition was more gradual in the former. Modular networks avoid abrupt deterioration leading to extinctions, and thus modularity may slow down the rate of biodiversity loss (Wilmers 2007).

@Camacho2007 Quantitative analysis of the local structure of food webs

Stouffer et al. (2005) demonstrated, however, that it can
be easily generalized to provide similar agreement to the
niche (Williams and Martinez, 2000) or the nested-hierarchy
(Cattin et al., 2004) models as compared to many empirical
food webs. The generalization consists in that the prob-
ability x with which a species i feeds on species j with n j pn i
is not the same for every predator i, but it is drawn at
random from a probability distribution pðxÞ given by
pðxÞ 1⁄4 bð1  xÞ ðb1Þ ,

the so-called beta-distribution (see Fig. 2).

The use of degree distributions to
characterize and compare network structure provides a
limited view of topology, because networks that have similar
degree distributions can have other properties that differ
quite dramatically [18,42]. A number of important properties
beyond degree distributions have been calculated for food
webs such as percentages of different types of taxa (e.g., basal
species, omnivores, cannibals) [15], overall web statistics (e.g.,
mean trophic level, standard deviation of chain lengths,
variability in the numbers of consumers or resources per
species) [15], ‘‘small-world’’ properties (mean shortest path
length, clustering coefficient) [21], the occurrence of small
motifs [20,43], and the scaling of minimum spanning trees
[22,24]. A simple network model called the ‘‘niche model’’ [15]
successfully reproduces many of these features of empirical
food-web structure [15,18,25,31,41,43], in addition to degree
distributions [17,19]

Generalities of food web structure have been identified for extant ecosystems.
However, the trophic organization of ancient ecosystems is unresolved,
as prior studies of fossil webs have been limited by low-resolution, high-
uncertainty data. We compiled highly resolved, well-documented feeding inter-
action data for 700 taxa from the 48 million-year-old latest early Eocene Messel
Shale, which contains a species assemblage that developed after an interval of
protracted environmental and biotal change during and following the end-
Cretaceous extinction. We compared the network structure of Messel lake and
forest food webs to extant webs using analyses that account for scale dependence
of structure with diversity and complexity.

The r package island is inspired by the simplicity of the Theory of Island Biogeography. Our package includes a suite of functions to easily confront models of increasing complexity to community data from the simplest stochastic model underlying Island Biogeography Theory to more elaborate models that include species responses to environmental variables and imperfect detectability, obtained at regular or irregular sampling times, using maximum‐likelihood and AIC ‐based model selection.
Models implemented in island should be regarded as simple approximations of true temporal community dynamics. In this sense, we call them effective models which we use to estimate effective parameters . These models are simple, but dynamic, as opposed to purely statistical. We illustrate the concept of dynamic effective models by using an immigration–birth–death stochastic model of population dynamics. We generated simulated community data to demonstrate the correspondence between the underlying true model parameters values and our effective parameter estimates.
We present three examples showcasing the uses of our package: detectability estimation and model selection, influence of environmental covariates on community dynamics and estimation of co‐occurrence networks. Three detailed vignettes with a full set of examples accompany the r Package island available on CRAN .

The TTIB incorporates a trophic constraint not considered in the TIB: consumers must have a prey on the islands they colonize to be able to establish and persist. Therefore, the richness of the local assemblage and their biotic interactions are defined by the equilibrium between colonization and extinction processes, where species that are diet generalists and/or belong to lower trophic levels are preferentially selected given that they are less affected by the trophic constraint. Generalist species have been shown to be faster colonizers than specialists, ultimately shifting community structure through time 16,35 . We expect stronger impact of this trophic con- straint at smaller areas, where the number of species is smaller. As area increases, the number of species also increases, which in turn increases the opportunity for consumers to find a prey, and therefore not only generalist species will be able to colonize, but also specialists, ultimately promoting changes in network structure as area changes. We use the TTIB model 16 to generate islands of different sizes based on different colonization/extinction ratios, where colonization rate is fixed to analyse the network structure resulting from the assembly process for each island size (Fig 1; Supplementary Methods)

Species pool richness and composition are 
influenced by metacommunity dynamics over short
timescales and by speciation, extinction, and dispersal
over long timescales. We suggest that a stronger focus
on the geography of speciation, the formation of sec-
ondary sympatry, and the feedback between local and
regional processes is needed to fully understand com-
munity assembly and the importance of dynamic species
pools.
