# From Local to regional and continental food web structure  

## Hypothesis

Meta-web --> Weddell Sea : Random sampling (Local Motif representation should match the meta-web)

Meta-web --> Potter Cove : Habitat Filtering (Local Motif representation should be different from the meta-web)

Motifs provide a novel framework for exploring community assembly by explicitly including interactions as opposed to inferring them from patterns of taxonomic or phylogenetic composition. Focusing on community assembly through the lens of motifs can be thought of as interaction assembly. We analyze motifs in the assembly of ecological networks by using null models to search for motif significance (Milo et al. 2002, Bascompte and Melián 2005) at the regional and local scale and then comparing the representation of each motif (i.e. over-represented, under-represented, or random) between the regional and local networks to see if they match. When a given motif shows the same representation in the regional network and local networks assembled from it, the same forces (e.g. predation, resource limitation, neutral processes) may be structuring networks across scales. In this scenario, the local networks are representative subsets that maintain the motif patterns present in the regional network. On the other hand, when a motif shows a different representation across scales, it suggests that different processes are structuring the regional and local networks. The ecological theory associated with the above-mentioned food web motifs allows us to make predictions about when a given motif might be over-represented, under-represented, or random at both scales or show a divergent pattern of motif representation.

For example, the tri-trophic chain motif (Fig. 1) may show a pattern of over-representation in the regional network due to the fact that generalist top predators exist in the regional pool (e.g. a generalist top predator may only occur in one local food web, but all of the tri-trophic chains that it is part of will be present in the regional network). However, we know that low productivity (Kaunzinger and Morin 1998) and small ecosystem size among other factors (Post 2002), can reduce the probability that a species will establish at a high trophic level. As a result, the tri-trophic motif may be under-represented in local food webs. Conversely, if local ecosystems are large and/or productive, top predators may frequently be present and the tri-trophic chain motif may be over-represented showing the same pattern as the regional network. Within the metacommunity framework (Leibold et  al. 2004), this above scenario is similar to the species sorting concept. However, instead of variation in local conditions driving the establishment of individual species, our approach focuses on the number of motifs and as a result provides a potential mechanism for the assembly of food web networks (e.g. low productivity or ecosystem size precludes long chain lengths at local scales). An alternative mechanism for over-representation of the tri-trophic chain motif in the regional network and under-representation in local scale networks is that higher level consumers are poor dispersers. These are just a few examples of how ecological theory can inform our predictions of motif patterns during community assembly.

Compartments in food webs act directly to
buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community
and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species.

We show that in the absence of perturbations, modularity is negatively correlated with metapopulation size (number of compartments). However, even when a small local perturbation occurs, this negative effect is offset by a buffering effect that
protects the majority of the nodes from the perturbation.

We detected considerable differences in structural properties and link configuration between the boreal and the arctic food webs, the latter being more modular and less connected. We found that a main characteristic of the boreal fish moving poleward into the arctic region of the Barents Sea is high generalism, a property that increases connectance and reduces modularity in the arctic marine food web. Our results reveal that habitats form natural boundaries for food web modules, and that generalists play an important functional role in coupling pelagic and benthic modules. We posit that these habitat couplers have the potential to promote the transfer of energy and matter between habitats, but also the spread of pertubations [I DO not think so!!]

Recent work has shown how the presence of
particular network ‘motifs’ — repeating patterns of connections
between a small number of nodes — can guarantee, for example, a
chaotic attractor for the network as a whole [36]. The functional
requirements of some real-world system may then lead to the
inclusion of particular motifs to guarantee the necessary dynamics
[37], and there is no necessary link between a system’s motifs and
its global topological properties (of which small-world-ness is but
one). Nonetheless, given that so many of the key motifs identified
so far are either complete 3-node loops or contain them [37,38],
the global topology will have a high clustering coefficient, and will
most likely be a small-world network

Network analyses can provide insights into
community local stability (Allesina and Tang 2012) and
robustness to extinctions (Riede et al. 2011), the degree of
specialization of individual species or guilds (Dorado et al.
2011), the impact of invasive species or climate change on
established communities (Lopezaraiza-Mikel et  al. 2007)
and, more generally, on any question in which pairwise
interactions relate to community patterns and processes.

For example, among the factors reported to
stabilize food webs are high modularity and low connectance
(Thébault and Fontaine 2010), correlation in pairwise
interaction strengths (Tang et al. 2014), trophic coherence
(Johnson et  al. 2014), a preponderance of weak (McCann
et al. 1998) and asymmetrical interactions (Bascompte et al.
2006), degree distributions broader than those of random
graphs (Allesina et al. 2015), or the appearance of general-
ist consumers coupling resources with different interaction
strengths (Rip et al. 2010).

Another important question emerging from our study is how these food webs with SW topologies are constructed through community assembly rules, that is, how they are built dynamically. Even if a community is assembled by random addition of species through a process of biological invasions, interactions can lead to non-random webs (Drake, 1990a, b). The SW topology might be related to underlying community level constraints and might help in understanding as to how biodiversity emerges and persists through time.

Thanks to Pauly and colleagues’ seminal paper “Fishing down marine food webs” [57], the mean trophic level has come to be regarded as an indicator of an ecosystem’s health, to the extent that the Convention on Biological Diversity has mandated that signatory states report changes in this measure (renamed the Mean Trophic Index) for marine ecosystems.

It has recently been shown that the high linear stability of food
webs is determined mainly by a structural feature called “trophic
coherence,” a measure of how neatly nodes fall into distinct lev-
els (15). Trophic coherence, moreover, has been found to play
an important role in other structural and dynamical properties
of networks (16, 17).

The graphs corresponding to
food webs are significantly coherent (q/q < 1) and have slightly
lower mean trophic levels than the expectation (hsi/s̃ . 1).
The networks derived from gene regulation have coherence and
mean trophic levels that are very close to their expected val-
ues. Meanwhile, the networks linked to metabolism are signif-
icantly incoherent (q/q̃ > 1) and have mean trophic levels that
are higher than expected (hsi/s̃ > 1)
